# Repository Summary: Food Delivery Modular Monolith

This repository implements a modular monolith architecture for a food delivery application. It is structured to support scalability, maintainability, and modularity, with a focus on domain-driven design principles. Below is an overview of the key components and structure of the repository:

## Key Features

- **Modular Monolith Architecture**: The application is divided into distinct modules, each representing a specific domain or functionality.
- **Building Blocks**: Reusable components and abstractions for common functionalities such as caching, CQRS, domain logic, messaging, persistence, and more.
- **API Layer**: A centralized API project to expose application functionalities.
- **Testing**: Dedicated test projects for building blocks, modules, and shared utilities.
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose configurations for infrastructure setup.

## Repository Structure

### Root Directory

- **food-delivery-modular-monolith.sln**: Solution file for the project.
- **global.json**: Configuration for the .NET SDK version.
- **LICENSE**: Licensing information.
- **README.md**: General information about the repository.
- **stylecop.json**: StyleCop configuration for code style enforcement.

### HTTP Clients

- Contains REST client configurations for interacting with external services.
- Subdirectories include `catalogs`, `customers`, and `identity`.

### Assets

- Contains visual assets such as architecture diagrams and module illustrations.

### Deployments

- **docker-compose**: Contains Docker Compose files for setting up infrastructure services.

### Source Code (`src/`)

- **Api**: The main API project (`FoodDelivery.Api`) with configuration files, program entry point, and extensions.
- **BuildingBlocks**: Reusable components organized into subprojects such as `Abstractions`, `Caching`, `Core`, `Email`, `Logging`, `Monitoring`, `Persistence`, `Resiliency`, `Security`, `Swagger`, `Validation`, and `Web`.
- **Modules**: Domain-specific modules including `Catalogs`, `Customers`, `Identity`, and `Orders`.

### Tests (`tests/`)

- Contains test projects for building blocks, modules, and shared utilities.
- Organized into subdirectories such as `building-blocks`, `modules`, and `shared`.

## Highlights

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: The repository is structured to align with DDD principles, ensuring clear boundaries between domains.
- **Vertical Slice Architecture**: Promotes separation of concerns by organizing code by features rather than technical layers.
- **Extensibility**: The modular design allows for easy addition of new features or modules.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Docker Compose files simplify the setup of required infrastructure services.

This repository serves as a robust foundation for building scalable and maintainable food delivery applications.
