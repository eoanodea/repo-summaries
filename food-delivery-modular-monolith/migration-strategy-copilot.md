# Migration Strategy to Microservices

Based on "Migration to Microservices: a Quality-Driven Approach" by R. Capuano.

## 1. Objectives & Quality Goals

- Maintain functional parity and service-level agreements during migration.
- Ensure maintainability, scalability, resilience, and security.
- Automate testing, CI/CD, and observability from day one.

## 2. Assessment & Planning

- Inventory modules and dependencies (Catalogs, Customers, Identity, Orders).
- Identify bounded contexts and data ownership areas.
- Define service SLAs, performance targets, and failure budgets.
- Establish a shared glossary and domain model.
- Setup CI pipelines and feature flags for incremental rollout.

## 3. Phased Extraction

### Phase 1: Strangling the Monolith

- Introduce an API Gateway in front of `FoodDelivery.Api`.
- Route traffic per-domain via feature flags.
- Implement facade layer to delegate calls.

### Phase 2: Extract Customer Service

- Extract the `Customers` module into an independent service:
  - Create `customers-service` repository.
  - Move domain, persistence, and API endpoints.
  - Introduce database-per-service and design API contracts using OpenAPI.
- Migrate incremental traffic behind a feature flag.

### Phase 3: Extract Identity Service

- Apply the same steps to `Identity` module.
- Integrate with existing OAuth/OIDC flows.

### Phase 4: Extract Catalogs & Orders

- Extract `Catalogs` and `Orders` as separate services.
- Define event-driven contracts via messaging (e.g., Kafka).
- Implement data replication or CQRS patterns for cross-service queries.

## 4. Integration & Communication

- Adopt asynchronous messaging for domain events.
- Use REST/gRPC for synchronous calls with circuit breakers.
- Ensure idempotency and resilience at service boundaries.

## 5. Data Migration

- Migrate each domain to its own datastore (Postgres for transactional, Mongo for document stores).
- Use Change Data Capture (CDC) or ETL scripts for live data sync.

## 6. Testing & Quality Assurance

- Maintain existing integration tests against the monolith.
- Add contract tests for each service API.
- Introduce end-to-end tests via consumer-driven contracts.
- Define Service-Level Indicators (SLIs) and automate regression checks.

## 7. Deployment & Observability

- Containerize each service with Docker.
- Orchestrate with Kubernetes or Docker Compose.
- Implement centralized logging, metrics (Prometheus), and tracing (Jaeger).
- Configure health checks, auto-restart, and self-healing.

## 8. Incremental Rollout & Feedback

- Roll out each service behind feature flags.
- Monitor error rates, latencies, and throughput.
- Use canary deployments and traffic shifting.
- Iterate based on quality metrics and stakeholder feedback.

## 9. Continuous Improvement

- Refine service boundaries as domain evolves.
- Optimize data contracts and reduce coupling.
- Enhance security with zero-trust patterns.
- Regularly review technical debt and refactor.

_This strategy enables a gradual, quality-driven migration from a modular monolith to a robust microservices architecture._
