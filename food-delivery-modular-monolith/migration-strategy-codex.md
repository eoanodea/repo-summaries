> Prompt - based on Migration to Microservices: a Quality-Driven Approach by R. Capuano, can you create a migration strategy for this repository

Here’s a high-level, quality-driven migration strategy—based on Capuano’s approach—for evolving this Food-Delivery modular monolith into a set of microservices. I’ve tailored it to the structure and “building-blocks” you already have in this repo.

## 1. Pre-Migration Assessment

- Inventory & document your current bounded contexts (Modules/Catalogs, Customers, Identity, Orders) and their dependencies.
- Capture your quality-attribute drivers (throughput, latency, availability, maintainability, etc.) for each context.
- Sketch a “target picture” of candidate microservices and their interfaces (REST + async events).

## 2. Foundation & Enabling Infrastructure

- Extract/repackage your BuildingBlocks projects as internal NuGet feeds.
- Containerize each future service (you already have `docker-compose.infrastructure.yaml`).
- Provision a service registry/discovery (e.g. Consul/Eureka) and API Gateway (e.g. Ocelot) in place of your current `FoodDelivery.Api`.
- Stand up a message bus (e.g. RabbitMQ/Kafka) for domain-event integration.
- Define shared cross-cutting contracts: logging, monitoring, tracing, resiliency (you already have BuildingBlocks.Logging, .Monitoring, .Resiliency).

## 3. Strangler-Style Extraction, One Module at a Time

### a. Identity Service (low coupling, well-bounded)

- Create new `FoodDelivery.Identity.Api` project, port over `Modules/Identity` code & migrations.
- Migrate its database schema into a dedicated Postgres instance.
- Publish domain events (`UserCreated`, `UserAuthenticated`).
- In the monolith’s gateway, replace in-process calls with HTTP (via your `_httpclients/identity.rest`).
- Smoke-test end-to-end.

### b. Catalog Service

- New `FoodDelivery.Catalogs.Api`, import `Modules/Catalogs`.
- Migrate its schema, wire up `catalogs.rest` client in the gateway.
- Introduce cache-aside pattern via BuildingBlocks.Caching.

### c. Customers Service

### d. Orders Service

- Order has the most complex transactional needs: introduce Sagas via BuildingBlocks.Integration.Hangfire or a lightweight orchestrator.
- Emit/consume integration events for reservation, payment, fulfillment.

## 4. Data Management & Consistency

- Move to “Database per Service.” Use anti-corruption layers in the monolith to translate old EF models into service payloads.
- Manage distributed transactions with Saga patterns or event compensations.
- Gradually repoint monolith data-access to service APIs until the module code is entirely removed.

## 5. Cross-cutting Concerns

- Centralized logging (ELK/Seq) via BuildingBlocks.Logging.
- Monitoring & health-checks (Prometheus + Grafana) via BuildingBlocks.Monitoring.
- Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry/Jaeger).
- Security: consolidate auth in Identity Service, propagate tokens via API Gateway.

## 6. CI/CD, Observability & Resiliency

- Build independent pipelines per service with versioned Docker images.
- Canary/blue-green deployments.
- Circuit breakers and retries via BuildingBlocks.Resiliency.
- End-to-end contract tests (pact-style) between services and the gateway.

## 7. Cut-over & Monolith Decommissioning

- Once all four modules live as microservices and the monolith only holds “glue” (gateway, BFF), you can sunset the monolith code entirely.
- Archive or repurpose the old solution; your new system is a fully disaggregated, independently deployable set of services.

## Risks & Mitigations

- Data skew during cut-over → use dual-write or event replay tools.
- Increased operational overhead → invest early in DevOps automation.
- Inter-service latency → benchmark and co-locate critical services.

---

This phased, strangler-style approach keeps your system live throughout the migration, lets you validate each service in isolation, and aligns with your existing building-blocks and HTTP-client layers. Let me know if you’d like more detail on any phase or a concrete folder/project layout for the new services.
